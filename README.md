# Home_automation_system_stm32
A concise, modular home automation system leveraging the STM32 Black Pill microcontroller. This project integrates automated lighting, smoke and gas detection, RFID-based access control, adaptive lighting, and climate monitoring for enhanced safety, comfort, and energy efficiency.

# Features

1. Automated Lighting: Motion-based lighting control using a PIR sensor for energy conservation.

2. Smoke & Gas Detection: MQ-2 sensor for real-time smoke and LPG gas monitoring with buzzer alerts.

3. RFID Access Control: Secure entry using RFID cardsâ€”only authorized users can access.

4. Adaptive Lighting: LDR sensor and servo motor for dynamic LED brightness adjustment based on ambient light.

5. Climate Monitoring: DHT22 sensor for temperature and humidity tracking with alert functionality.

6. OLED Display: Real-time system status and sensor readings.

# System Overview
1. Automated Lighting: Lights turn on/off based on room occupancy.

2. Hazard Detection: Immediate alerts for smoke/gas presence.

3. Access Control: Only authorized RFID cards grant entry.

4. Adaptive Lighting: LED brightness adjusts to ambient light.

5. Climate Monitoring: Displays and alerts for temperature/humidity extremes.

  # Future Enhancements
1. IoT integration for remote monitoring and control

2. Voice assistant compatibility (Alexa, Google Assistant)

3. Advanced sensors (e.g., camera for facial recognition)

4. Mobile app for user-friendly control
